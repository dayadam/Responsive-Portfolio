            <p>My name is Adam Day. I grew up in Lawrenceville, Georgia and graduated from Dacula High School. Growing
                up, I was on the swim team and played multiple wind instruments. I also really enjoyed video games, and
                I always wished I had the knowledge to make one, but I never had the resources to learn.
            </p>
            <p>I went to the University of Georgia for my undergraduate degree in Environmental Engineering. Go Dawgs! I
                love watching UGA football, and I was in the redcoats. I wanted to use my analytical abilities to help
                the world, so I majored in engineering.
            </p>
            <p>For the past few years, I've been working as a civil engineer. I also have an incredible German Shephard
                named Louise! Unfortunately, I have found civil engineering unfulfilling. I want to have a merit-based
                career outside of the government. So I have decided to pursue software development! I think it will be a
                much better fit for me in the long run and I'm very excited to have the courage to chase my life-long
                dream.
